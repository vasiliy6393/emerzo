The application is written for myself, but if you
have suggestions, I may issue a version taking into
account your wishes. The application was tested on only
one PC, but should work on all Gentoo-based distributions.
It is important only to satisfy dependencies.

Dependencies:
app-shells/bash
app-misc/screen
x11-misc/gtkdialog

Optional dependencies:
gnome-extra/zenity
app-admin/sudo (or launch as root)
x11-misc/wmctrl and x11-apps/xinput (for change of window title)
x11-misc/kdocker (for rolling into a system tray)
                 If you do not want to use system tray
                 change Source code.

Install:
cd /some_dir
tar xvf /path/to/emerzo.tar.gz ./

Launch:
/some_dir/emerzo.sh

You can also rename the script as needed.
