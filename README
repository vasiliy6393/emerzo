The application was created with pure enthusiasm and in leisure time.

Dependences:
x11-misc/gtkdialog

Install:
mkdir /emerzo
cd /emerzo
tar xvf /path/to/emerzo.tar ./

Launch:
/emerzo/main.sh

The next plans:
 * Fix the known bugs (Clear button)
 * Install in the user-selected directory
 * Write an installation script
 * Perhaps, change of design
